# (Task 6) Crop-Prediction & Recommendation 

## Problem Statement
Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that aims to solve the problem of farmers selecting the wrong crop based on their soil requirements, resulting in reduced productivity. By utilizing research data on soil characteristics and crop yield data collection, precision agriculture can suggest the right crop based on site-specific parameters, ultimately leading to increased productivity for farmers.


### Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to predict the most suitable crop to grow on a particular farm

#### Evaluation critera & Metrics
  - evaluated using Accuracy Score.


##### What I learnt & explored 
 - Exploratory Data Analysis 
 - Supervised Learning Algorithms - Classification Techniques
